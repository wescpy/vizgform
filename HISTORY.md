# History of creating this code with Claude Code

Google Forms are a popular way to solicit the same information from different people. You create your questions, and determine the type of query, whether it's multiple choice, free-form response, etc., then publish and share it for people to access. Forms responses go into Google Sheets, and there's a specific one for every Form. The primary issue is that while spreadsheets are a great user interface (UI) on top of structured data, they're merely used as databases to store Forms responses, not as a visual tool. Furthermore, Forms responses are typically ill-suited for viewing in a Sheet because the data isn't formatted for viewing... they're merely a great place to store such data then export elsewhere as desired, whether as a CSV, PDF, or imported into a (real) database. The purpose of this project is/was to create a more user-friendly viewer for Forms data. While it works fine to view _all_ spreadsheets, it's really intended for Forms creators to better visualize participant responses.

Other than this file, everything else was generated by Claude Code, perhaps with some slightly text-only editing of some config files by me.

## Original prompt: create web app
Create a web app. The frontend should be in Vue preferably but React is acceptable if it's the better tool for the job. The backend should be in either Python or Typescript, again, whichever is the better tool for the job.  The user interface uses the Google Drive API to read all the Google Sheets files available to the end user. The authorization scheme should be user auth with OAuth client IDs and not service account auth. The frontend presents all the available Sheets files and lets the user select one. When the desired file is selected, the app will use the Google Sheets API using the same credentials it used to access the Drive API, import the data and present each row of data formatted in a user-friendly and visually-appealing way that is easier for humans to read than as a spreadsheet.

### Results
The app was created as advertised, but I kept running into a pair of primary errors preventing the app from functioning stably or at all:

1. The client and server web servers just wouldn't stay up. Claude has to spend many cycles shutting things down, restarting, and adding code & monitoring log outputs to see why it was the case. I still don't have a root cause for this, but when it runs correctly, both servers seem to stay up, so I'm "letting it slide" for now.
1. "Failed to load spreadsheet data" was a common error. Claude also spent a huge amount of time (and tokens) to diagnose, debug, etc. It wasn't until it added enough logging code that actually let me see the error from Google servers that I was able to quickly determine the root cause, which turns out to be: _I didn't even enable these APIs._ So sad. Anyway, once I fixed that, I got the 1st working version, which I saved into a tarball before issuing the next prompt:

## Next prompt: solely user authz (no API keys)
Change the application so that API keys are not required. Do not use the Google API discovery service and HTTP to connect to either the Drive nor Sheets APIs. Instead use the Google APIs client library for Node.js.

### Results
During the process of asking it to create a tarball for the 1st working version of the app, I was perplexed as to why it was using API keys since both APIs clearly only needed user auth, and I specified this in my original prompt too (see above). It also used the Google APIs Discovery service, which is odd and really only meant for those who access Google APIs via HTTP and/or aren't using the client libraries. These were the reasons for my 2nd prompt above. After making the changes and debugging several times, I arrived at the current working version which I also tarballed. Next, I'll probably:

1. Ask Claude to remove the "Home" link in the upper right because there are no other pages other than the main page, making this link superfluous.
1. Create a search bar to search for spreadsheets that don't show up in the UI (user interface). (I'm not sure why I'm getting a [very] limited number of Sheets because the Drive API defaults to 100 if `maxResults` not provided. That means I haven't looked at the code that executes the Drive query yet. Regardless, not every Sheets file shows up in the UI, so the search bar gives users an opportunity to ask for a specific one if not found in the default list.
